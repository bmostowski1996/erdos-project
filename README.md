## New to GitHub?
This repo will act as a place to host the definitive "main" version of the code. When we are finished, you can link to this project as a show of the work you did. Prior to working on the project, install GitHub Desktop and connect your GitHub account. When you sit down to work on the code, do a "pull" from this repo prior to starting. When you finish working on your code for the day, "commit" your changes and then "push" them using GitHub Desktop.
